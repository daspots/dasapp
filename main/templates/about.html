      <p class="pRightBig">Discovering great places to grab a bite and have a drink in New York should be fun and easy. That's why we are here. No five-star restaurants we can't afford, no ' bleh, I don't get what the fuzz is about' places. Just the cool, undiscovered and authentic places recommended by people who love food as much as you.</p>
