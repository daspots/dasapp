        <p class="pLeft">DASPOTS is a website, newsletter, and instagram feed that hosts recommendations on where to find some of the best places to eat and drink in New York. These recommendations will be provided those who are passionate about food â€” they grow it, make it, serve it, style it, enjoy it and everything in between!
        </p>
        <p class="pLeft">Our frustration with unreliable reviews from sponsored bloggers and boorish tourists led us to create DASPOTS. We considered that this was not only an issue that we faced individually, but that many others struggled with finding reliable reviews on good quality restaurants and eateries. What better way to find them, than to create these reviews ourselves.
        </p>
        <p class="pLeft">Our mission is to bring you recommendations that are grounded in honesty and come from those who love and care about quality within the entrepreneurial food culture of New York City. We strive to bridge the gap between you and all of the food there is in New York City in an entirely new way.</p>
